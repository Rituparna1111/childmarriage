          <img class="cause-1" src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Child marriage\pic3.jpg" alt="cause-1" height="190">
          <p>Gender inequality means that women and girls are treated as second-class citizens, denied their human rights and valued less because of their gender.Child marriage is one expression of this gender inequality.It is rooted in gender inequality and the belief that girls and women are inferior to boys and men.This can mean controlling how a girl behaves and dresses, where she goes, who she sees, and if, who and when she marries.</p>

          <img class="cause-2" src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Child marriage\pic4.jpg" alt="cause-2" height="190">
          <p>Social norms are informal rules of behaviour in a group. People follow them to show they are members of the group, because of social pressure or coercion by power holders, or because it’s what they’ve always done.Social norms are often gendered and aim to control women and girls’ sexuality, and maintain longstanding practices. Child marriage is one such practice. In many places, it has happened for generations and has become normal and accepted.</p>

        <img class="effect-pic" src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Child marriage\pic7.jpg" alt="effect-pic" height="190" width="230">

        <img class="edu-pic" src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Child marriage\pic6.jpg" alt="end-pic" height="200"width="300">
        <p class="educating">One of the best ways to end child marriage is to keep girls in school.Each year of secondary education may reduce the likelihood of marrying before the age of 18 by five percentage points or more in many countries. By contrast, child brides are much more likely to drop out of school and complete fewer years of education than their peers who marry early.By keeping girls in school,girls would have had a better chance for safety and security, to health and education, and to make their own life choices and decisions.</p>
